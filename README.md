# BrushCustomShaderFallbackSample
This sample project highlights the limitations of the Brush custom shader feature when employed on devices running API level 33 or lower. When the device operates on an Android OS version lower than 13, the app will utilize OpenGL ES2 to render the shader onto the Fullscreen Quad.<br>

### Tested on:
Pixel6a, Pixel3a, Aquos SH-01(Android OS 9)
