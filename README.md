# BrushCustomShaderFallbackSample
This sample project illustrates the limitations of the Brush custom shader feature when utilized on devices running API level 33 or lower. On devices with an Android OS version lower than 13, the app will resort to using OpenGL ES2 to render the shader onto the Quad.<br>
This project serves as the simplest starting point for implementing a full-screen shader effect.<br>

### Tested on:
Pixel6a, Pixel3a, Aquos SH-01(Android OS 9)
